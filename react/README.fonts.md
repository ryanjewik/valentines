Place Panda Chubby font files in `public/fonts/` and ensure filenames match:

- PandaChubby.woff2
- PandaChubby.woff
- PandaChubby.ttf

You can copy them from your `e:\panda-chubby` folder (or where you keep the font files). The project will load `/fonts/PandaChubby.woff2` first (recommended).

License: keep the EULA text alongside the fonts (e.g., `public/fonts/1001fonts-panda-chubby-eula.txt`).

If you prefer to commit font binaries, remove or edit the `.gitignore` entry for `public/fonts/`.
